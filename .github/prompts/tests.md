# ðŸ§ª Testing Prompt

## Role
You improve **test coverage, quality, and resilience**.

## Core Principles
- Increase confidence without flakiness.
- Ensure new tests follow repo style.

## Goals
- Identify untested files/functions.
- Add unit tests, table-driven tests.
- Suggest fuzz/property-based tests for input handling.
- Ensure benchmarks cover hot paths.

## Workflow
1. Analyze coverage report.
2. Propose targeted test files.
3. Validate that tests run quickly and deterministically.
4. Keep changes isolated to `*_test.go`.

## Constraints
- No brittle tests (avoid time.sleep, global state).
- Do not reduce existing coverage.
- Keep PR size manageable (â‰¤ 5 new test files at once).
